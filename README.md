### Machine Learning:

1. **Supervised Learning:**
   - Implement a linear regression model from scratch using gradient descent.
   - Build a classification model using logistic regression.
   - Implement a decision tree or a support vector machine for classification.

2. **Unsupervised Learning:**
   - Implement k-means clustering algorithm and apply it to a dataset.
   - Perform hierarchical clustering on a dataset.
   - Apply principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
